The repository contains Basilisk-C code for solving the flow of a viscoelastic drop inside a constricted channel with sudden contraction. The code solves the problem discussed in the paper "Prasad, N. K., Ghosh, S. S., & Dalal, A. (2023). Understanding deformation and breakup tendency of shear-thinning viscoelastic drops in constricted microchannels. Langmuir, 39(34), 11975-11991." The repository also contains a library that allows for generating .plt files for post-processing with Tecplot.
